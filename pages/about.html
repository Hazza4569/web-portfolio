            I am a physicist by training, with a passion for programming and
            statistical data analysis. My education has allowed me to develop
            excellent problem solving, critical thinking, and mathematical
            skills.  These are skills that I leverage for developing software,
            which I have over 10 years of experience with, in C++, Python, and
            a variety of other languages; <a onclick="scrollToElement('Skills')">
            see more here</a>.  Writing code was a core responsibility of my
            PhD, used daily in manipulating and analysing large datasets,
            simulating detector hardware, and interfacing with large software
            frameworks.

            My career in physics research has also granted me excellent
            inter-personal and communication skills, through collaborating in
            large groups on various projects within the ATLAS experiment. I
            presented my work regularly in concise updates at working group
            meetings as well as giving large talks at conferences to motivate
            and share my research.
